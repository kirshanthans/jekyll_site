				<h5><strong>A Primer on the Irregular Programs</strong></h5>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Regular programs operate over linear data structures such as dense matrices and arrays. 
				Unlike them, the programs which operate over <b>pointer-based data structures such as trees and graphs</b> are known as irregular programs. 
				Research in the past has led to the creation of catalogs of performance-enhancing transformations for regular programs.
				In contrast, there have been relatively few works targeting irregular programs for enhancing performance.
				Even though work has been done to enhance specific irregular applications, general approaches to improving the performance of broad classes of irregular applications are rare.
				Pointer-based data structures are difficult optimize because they are,
				<ul>
					<li>Input-dependent,</li>
					<li>Highly dynamic and,</li>
					<li>Defined recursively.</li>
				</ul>
				It is unsurprising that generalization of optimizations on irregular programs is a hard problem.

				<h5><strong>TreePoly: A Polyhedral Framework for Tree Traversals</strong></h5>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Loops are the iterative construct of choice when it comes to regular programs. 
				Not only there has been work done to enhance the performance of loop-based programs, but also fairly deep research has been done to construct frameworks to analyze the composition of such transformations. 
				The polyhedral framework is one such well-known framework for composing of transformations for loops.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				These frameworks work well on loops and iterative iteration spaces with affine bounds. 
				In contrast, there is no such framework for analyzing and composing transformations meant for irregular programs. 
				When it comes to irregular programs the convenient choice of iteration construct is recursion. 
				Even though it is possible to write irregular programs using loops, those programs result in irregular loop bounds and make unfavorable for pass-through frameworks in order to end up with performance enhancement. 
				Hence designing a framework dedicated to analyze and compose transformations on irregular programs is an interesting research problem.

				<h5><strong>TreeDataflow: A Dataflow Framework for Tree Traversals</strong></h5>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Control flow is the natural way of writing programs since the advent of programmable machines. 
				The biggest disadvantage of control flow would be the control dependencies imposed, even though they do not contribute to the correctness of the computation. 
				In contrast, unlike control flow, dataflow only imposes the data dependencies. 
				Hence these programs are amenable to parallelization at different granularities and exploitation of schedules inapparent in control flow. 
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
				Considering different factors such as ease of programmability and learning curve of a new paradigm, dataflow appears to be comparatively difficult than control flow. 
				The task of automatically converting a control flow program to a dataflow one becomes pragmatically useful for a certain class of programs - for instance, tree traversals. 				    On a performance standpoint, exploring and exploiting different schedules of tree traversals seems to be an interesting research problem when they were expressed in a dataflow fashion considering their nature of the irregularity.
